### Functionals to analyze ###
# Functionals looking at marginals, vs functionals looking over a time step.

# Probabilities of a node being 1,or -1 at stationarity

# Occupation measure: fraction of time a node is at state 1 out of T timesteps.

#### Don't need to do the below for the Mean Field Simulation

# 2 nodes neighboring each other - get the joint distribution - at a large fixed time

# 2 nodes neighboring each other - look at joint distribution/ occupation measure.
